# Contributing to The Code

We believe in building with the community, not just for it. Here's how to participate.

---

## What's Open for Contribution

- Challenge how we apply the principles
- Propose new principles to consider
- Report errors in our research or reasoning
- Suggest topics for investigation
- Share relevant on-chain findings
- Propose projects aligned with The Code
- Share perspectives we're missing

## What's NOT Open for Revision

### The Seven Principles (`THE_CODE.md`)
The seven principles are foundational commitments, not proposals. They are:

1. Improve Life
2. No Greed
3. Under-Promise, Over-Deliver
4. Lift the Weak
5. Transparency Always
6. Fun Matters
7. Together, Not Instead

You can discuss them, challenge how we apply them, or propose new principles to add. But the existing seven are non-negotiable. If we ever contradict them, that's a valid issue to raise.

## Standards for Contributions

- **Evidence over opinion.** On-chain data, contract source code, and verifiable claims are preferred over speculation.
- **Constructive over combative.** We welcome disagreement. We don't welcome hostility.
- **Substance over volume.** One well-reasoned paragraph beats ten heated ones.

## A Note on Our Approach

We are investigators and advocates, not authorities. We share research, present findings, and invite correction. If you find an error in our work, that's not an attack on us — it's exactly what we asked for.

We would rather be corrected than comfortable.
